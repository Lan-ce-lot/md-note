   2） Block the quotes if it is more than three lines Carl（2002，p.l1）
   **claims Cheating is seeking to gain unfair advantage or breaking a regulation Plagiarism is one form of cheating Students often reverse this relationship**

   3）weave the quote into the sentence According to Carroll（2002）， the word plagiarism"is often wrongly used by students"to describe all academic dishonesty, so time spent clarifying definitions is usually time well spent

   4）Introduce quotation with signal phrases in the case of author-focused version 

   Lack（2002）claims, "serious concerns have been raised about the potential environmental and medical consequences

   signal phrases: admit, according to, argue, declare, maintain, insist, contend, emphasize, suggest, believe

   

   5）set the quote up with a colon if the quoted is a complete sentence

   Lack（2002）claims, "serious concerns have been raised about the potential environmental and medical consequences

   6） Quote as little as possible少用
   7） Provide in-text references for all quotes文内加注

   

4. two versions of quoting 

   Information-focused version is used when you want to focus on the information cited instead of the author. The reference is put at the end of the quote with the name and date in the bracket 

   当你想专注于引用的信息而不是作者时，可以使用信息聚焦版本。引用放在引号的末尾，名称和日期在括号中

   We all agree that time spent clarifying definitions is usually time well spent because the word plagiarism"is often wrongly used by students "to describe all academic dishonesty"（Carroll 2002）

   

   Author-focused version is used when we want to emphasize author's name showing more authority. The author's name is put at the beginning of the quote followed by a bracket with the time in it 当我们想强调作者的名字以显示更多的权威性时，就使用以作者为中心的版本。作者的名字放在引文的开头，后面跟着一个括号，括号里有时间

   According to Carroll （2002）， the word"plagiarism"is often wrongly used by students"to describe al academic dishonesty, so" time spent clarifying definitions is usually time well spent"

   

Introduce your quotes by stating the author's last name any necessary background information, and a signal verb（usu. in present tense）
