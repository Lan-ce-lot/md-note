## Synthesizing

1. Definition of Synthesizing

Synthesizing is to bring together multiple sources and show how ideas from different sources are related and make conclusions from this.综合是将多个来源汇集起来，展示不同来源的想法是如何相互关联的，并由此得出结论。

In the literature review section, this is the most frequently used writing skill, which requires more than simply summarizing a single source material.在文献综述部分，这是最常用的写作技巧，它需要的不仅仅是简单地总结单一的源材料。

2. Functions of synthesized sources

  1) to explain a concept解释一个概念
  2) to support argument支持论点

3. Steps to write a good synthesis

  In general, when writing synthesis, you must infer and then make explicit the relationships among separate sources .一般来说，在编写合成时，必须先推断并明确不同来源之间的关系。

  1) Find relevant sources about the topic.找到关于这个话题的相关来源。

  2) Read actively to find connections between different sources, such as different or similar definitions and explanations, causes and effects, and advantages and disadvantages.积极阅读以发现不同来源之间的联系，例如不同或相似的定义和解释、原因和影响以及优点和缺点。

  3) Summarize the relevant content in each source.总结每个来源中的相关内容。

  4) Piece together the summaries into a coherent text under a topic sentence which can summarize all the information.把总结拼凑成一篇连贯的文章，放在一个主题句下面，这个主题句可以概括所有的信息。

  5) Acknowledge the sources.确认消息来源。

  

  To sum up, your success in writing a good synthesis depends on your ability to `infer` relationships among different sources.总而言之，你能否写出一篇好的综合文章，取决于你能否“推断”不同来源之间的关系。

  Before you infer relationships, you must be able to summarize these sources. At the same time, you must go beyond `summary` to make judgments - judgments based on your critical reading of your sources.在你推断关系之前，你必须能够总结这些来源。同时，你必须超越“总结”来做出判断——根据你对你的资料的批判性阅读来做出判断。

  Because a synthesis is based on two or more sources, you will need to be selective when choosing information. For example, while you may use the sources to evaluate a text or argue a position on a topic, your classmate might use the same sources to explain cause-effect relationships, or compare and contrast items. You will use different parts of those sources and relate them to one another differently according to the different purposes of the assignments.因为合成是基于两个或多个源，所以在选择信息时需要有选择性。例如，当你可以使用这些来源来评价一篇文章或者争论一个话题的立场时，你的同学可以使用相同的来源来解释因果关系，或者比较和对比项目。你将使用这些资料的不同部分，并根据作业的不同目的，以不同的方式将它们联系起来。

  In addition to the perceived benefits of `genetic engineering` for the `industrialized nations`, proponents advocate the use of genetic engineering to `improve agriculture` in developing countries. This strategy might `help` these countries bypass expensive, high-input crop production and move their traditional agriculture toward low-input sustainable practices.

  How can `biotech help`? Biotechnologists have `developed`
  genetically mnodified rice that is fortified with beta-carotene --

  which the body converts into vitamin A --- and additional
  iron, and they are working on other kinds of nutritionally
  `improved` crops. Biotech can also `improve` farming
  productivity in places where food shortages are caused by
  crop damage attributed to pests, drought, poor soil, and crop
  viruses, bacteria or fungi.

  `Malnutrition` is common in third world countries where
  impoverished peoples rely on a single crop such rice for the
  main staple of their diet. However, rice does not contain
  adequate amounts of all necessary nutrients to prevent
  malnutrition. If rice could be `genetically engineered` to
  contain additional vitamins and minerals, nutrient
  deficiencies could be alleviated. For example, blindness due
  to vitamin A deficiency is a common problem in third world
  countries. Researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute of
  Technology have created a strain of“golden" rice containing
  an unusually high content of beta-carotene (vitamin A).

  Genetic engineering may offer many benefits especially for the developing countries. (Paoletti and Pimentel, 1996; Whitman, 2000; Goettlich, 2004).Among other things, it will promote their sustained
  development of agriculture as it can avoid expensive, high-input crop production (Paoletti and Pimentel, 1996). According to Goettlich (2004)，biotech can also improve farming productivity as well as the nutrition of crops. Most importantly, GM foods can make contribution to the alleviation of malnutrition which plagues people in many third world countries(Whitman, 2000).

  基因工程可以提供许多好处，特别是对发展中国家。（Paoletti和Pimentel，1996年；Whitman，2000年；Goettlich，2004年），除其他外，它将促进他们的可持续发展

  发展农业，因为它可以避免昂贵的高投入作物生产（Paoletti和Pimentel，1996）。根据Goettlich（2004），生物技术还可以提高农业生产力和作物的营养。最重要的是，转基因食品可以为缓解困扰许多第三世界国家人民的营养不良做出贡献（惠特曼，2000年）。

The effects of playing computer games on physical health are controversial. `Although` Brown (2000) states that computer games can cause physical problems such as bad posture and pain in the hands, Smith (2003) `argues` that these problems are caused by the hardware and equipment, not the games. In my opinion, the physical health problems are caused by games as they encourage long periods of computer use.玩电脑游戏对身体健康的影响是有争议的。尽管Brown（2000）指出电脑游戏会导致身体问题，比如姿势不好和手部疼痛，但是Smith（2003）认为这些问题是硬件和设备造成的，而不是游戏。在我看来，身体健康问题是由游戏引起的，因为游戏鼓励长时间使用电脑。

The hazard of GMOs was shown for animals and the environment is extensive investigations (Traavik, 1999; Ho and Tappeser, 1997; Pusztai, 1998 and 2001; Kuznetsov et al., 2004 and others).

Barab et al. (2005) and Squire (2004) both outline the benefits of game-based learning in education. These include higher levels of engagement, increased motivation, and enhanced visualization.
