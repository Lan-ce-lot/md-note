## Difference Between Paraphrasing and Summarizing

paraphrase is a restatement of the meaning of a sentence or a text using your own words.

As one of citation methods, paraphrasing an essential skill in academic studies as  you should not over-rely on direct quotations. It is suitable to paraphrase short pieces of information when it contains three or less sentences in length. When paraphrasing, you need to change the words, word forms and grammatical structures as much as possible, ensuring that a sequence of three words will not be the same as the original. But 1) do not change any of the ideas in the original information, and 2) do not remove any ideas, or add new ones.
Though rewriting the original one is like summarizing, paraphrasing differs in that it is usually about the same length as the original source by changing diction and structures while summarizing only contains its main ideas, leaving out details.

释义是用自己的话重述句子或文本的意思。

作为引文方法之一，在学术研究中，你不应该过度依赖直接引文来解释一项基本技能。当短信息包含三个或三个以下的句子时，它适合用来复述。在复述时，你需要尽可能地改变单词、单词形式和语法结构，确保一个由三个单词组成的序列与原文不一样。但是1）不要改变原始信息，和2）不要删除任何想法，或添加新的想法。

虽然改写原文就像总结一样，但释义的不同之处在于，它通常与原文长度相同，只是通过改变措辞和结构，而总结只包含其主要思想，而忽略了细节。

TASK
Com pare the following paraphrase and summary of the original text. Discuss with your partner about the characteristics of them.
The original text: The modern concept of democracy is the result of an evolution begun by the ancient Greeks. F or the Greeks, however, democracy was a right exercised only by the elite- -landowning men, a fraction of the population. Non-landowning men and women were normally excluded from any political involvement and were disenfranchised. Yes this condition was not believed to be a restriction on freedom, but
rather a reflection of society's values. Those of wealth and status were expected to hold the regions of power, as it was inherited right and responsibility to attend to the affairs of state.
Paraphrase: To the ancient Greeks, democracy meant that those possessing high social rank- a minute percentage of society- -had the duty to lead the state. Yet, rather than seeing this arrangement as a limitation of freedom, those excluded from political involvement, such as women and men without property, accepted it as an extension of the natural social order. Therefore, though contemporary democracy has evolved from ancient times, in its very early form, only the elite (normally landowning men) governed the entire state.
Summary: The ancient Greeks believed that only men occupying society' s highest class had the right and duty to govern in a democracy.

任务

对原文作如下释义和总结。与你的搭档讨论他们的特点。

原文：现代民主概念是古希腊人开始进化的结果。然而，对于希腊人来说，民主是一种只有精英才能行使的权利——拥有土地的人，是人口的一小部分。非土地所有的男女通常被排除在任何政治参与之外，被剥夺了公民权。是的，这个条件不被认为是对自由的限制，但是

而是社会价值观的反映。那些富有和地位的人被期望掌握权力的区域，因为他们继承了处理国家事务的权利和责任。

对古希腊人来说，民主意味着那些拥有高度社会地位的人

军衔——社会的一小部分——有责任领导国家。然而，更确切地说

而不是把这种安排看作是对自由的限制

政治参与，如没有财产的男女，都接受了

作为自然社会秩序的延伸。因此，尽管是当代的

民主从远古时代就开始了，在它的早期形式中，只有精英

（通常是地主）统治整个州。

摘要：古希腊人认为只有占据社会最高阶层的人

在民主政体中执政的权利和义务。
