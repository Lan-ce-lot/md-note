2. Reasons for hedging language 

   a crucial advantage in academia is that studies are often interpreted from multiple perspectives 

   

   This inherent openness leaves rooms for improvement and development in most fields of study which accounts for the use of hedging language, as no claim can be 100% sure



3. Purposes of the use of hedging
   1） To minimize the possibility of another academic opposing the claims that are being made
   2） To enable you as a writer to be more precise when reporting results, eg. you can show that something is not 100%o proven but rather it is indicated and subsequently assumed



3. Purposes of the use of hedging
   3） To conform to the currently accepted style of academic writing
   4） To enable the author to devise a politeness strategy in which they are able to acknowledge that there may be flaws in their claims
