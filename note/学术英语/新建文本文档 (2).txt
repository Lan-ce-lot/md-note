讨论二   summary

Summarize the paragraph into one or two sentences with in-text reference.

Teachers will not know what the students do not understand if there are elements of cheating among the students. It will be difficult for the teachers to regulate their approaches of instruction as they will assume the students are all doing fine, which might not be true. Cheating hurts the students and prevents teachers from providing the necessary and relevant feedback to their students in the learning process. This should b true to all the teachers who may be interested in providing useful information on what the students are doing or who want to make use of the information they receive from their students to prepare for classroom intervention programs.  (Hewitt, 1996)

//==================================================
Cheating cheats oneself and interferes with the teacher's teaching.

Summary:
Students' cheating influences themselves and interferes with teachers' teaching.
