6. Using visual aids

   Forms of visual aids:
   PPT slides ;
   Handouts
   blackboards

   Suggestions for PPT designing

   1. Avoid putting too much information on the slides. Your audience should be listening to you, not reading
      the slides behind you.避免在幻灯片上放太多信息。你的听众应该倾听你，而不是阅读你身后的幻灯片。

   2. Reduce the major points to words and phrases. Use fewer complete sentences on the slides unless you use direct quotations.把要点归纳成单词和短语。在幻灯片上少用完整的句子，除非你直接引用。

   3. Use bold typeface, and a reasonable size (say, 38-point text and 42-50-point titles), so that the audience can see your words clearly.使用粗体字和合理的大小(比如，38个点的文本和42-50个点的标题)，这样听众可以清楚地看到你的文字。

   4. Use double space and give your audience time to take notes when they read each slide. A wise speaker avoids crowding a slide with too many words.使用双倍的空间，当你的听众阅读每张幻灯片时，给他们时间做笔记。聪明的演讲者避免在幻灯片上塞入太多的单词。
   5. Use an informative diagram, an interesting chart or photograph. It helps make your points and important figures clear and attractive.使用信息丰富的图表、有趣的图表或照片。它有助于使你的观点和重要数据清晰和有吸引力。
   6. Simplicity is the best aesthetic. Your audience has very little time to absorb what is on your slide. It is not advisable to spend more time on producing PPT graphics than on the actual talk. Remember --- if your talk is poor, no amount of fancy graphics will save it!简单是最好的美学。你的听众几乎没有时间去理解你幻灯片上的内容。我们不建议在制作PPT图表上花费比实际演讲更多的时间。记住——如果你的演讲很糟糕，再多花哨的图片也无法挽救它

   7. The background should be in light colour and the words in dark colour to maintain an appropriate contrast.背景应该是浅色的，文字应该是深色的，以保持适当的对比。
   8. Avoid reading word-for-word from your PPT slides when you make a presentation; avoid standing
     in front of the screen in case you obscure the visual from the audience; avoid allowing the audience to see all the slide text at once.在做演示时，避免逐字逐句地阅读PPT幻灯片;避免站在屏幕前，以免模糊了观众的视觉;避免让观众一次看到所有的幻灯片文本。
   9. Pay attention to spelling and grammar. Always check your slides with another student.注意拼写和语法。总是和其他学生一起检查你的幻灯片。

​	Delivering Your Presentation
​	Some do's and don t's when delivering presentation

  		1. Speak loud enough for everyone in the room to hear you.

2. Speak slowly and clearly, especially key words and important points.
3. Vary your voice quality. Use a higher pitch and volume when you begin a new point.
4. Vary your speed. Don't deliver an entire talk in a uniform, unchanging speed. Speak with a particularly slow and deliberate voice when you emphasize key point.
5. Use pauses when you want to draw attention to a particular point. Silence can be articulate, giving the
  audience a chance to think and letting the key point sink in.
6. Smile at the audience with confidence. It makes you look friendly and confident.
7. Move a hand in the direction of the slide to indicate important information and turn your head to look
directly at the audience. Don't turn your back on the audience when presenting slide information.
8. Make sure your posture is naturally upright, with your arms held naturally. Don't keep your arms behind
  your back or cross your arms. It makes you look defensive.
9. Stand tall, with legs about shoulder width apart with weight evenly distributed.
10. Put one hand in your pocket if necessary. It makes you look confident. But remember to gesture with the
  other hand. Don't put both hands in your pockets. It makes you look bored and too casual.
11. Walk around, sometimes approaching the audience. Don't fix at one point during the whole presentation. Don't talk constantly. Too much movement can irritate as well as impress.
12. Hold your head up. Look around and make eye contact with people in the audience. Don 't look at your notes or your computer screen all the time.
13. Gesture with hands and arms to project a feeling of energy and excitement, to emphasize your points, and
   to engage your audience. Don 't speak motionlessly.
14. Don't play background music for academic presentation.
