Summarize the main idea of the paragraph

Iodine-131, plutonium-239, caesium-137, and strontium-90 are the four most harmful radioactive elements involved in the Japanese nuclear disaster. Iodine-131 has a half-life of eight days—meaning that it is half as radioactive after eight days, thus making its effects relatively short-lived. Exposure to iodine-131 can cause thyroid cancer. With half-lives of 30 and 29 years, respectively, caesium-137 and strontium-90 both stay in the environment for longer periods of time. Caesium-137 can travel through the food chain in milk or vegetables and can increase the risk of various cancers; strontium-90 is absorbed into bones and teeth and can increase the risk of leukemia or bone cancer. Plutonium-239 is toxic if inhaled.

总结本段的主要思想

碘131，p239，铯137和锶90是日本核灾难中涉及的四个最有害的放射性元素。 Iodine-131的半衰期为八天，这意味着八天后其放射性只有其一半，因此其作用相对较短。 暴露于碘131会导致甲状腺癌。 铯137和锶90的半衰期分别为30和29年，它们在环境中的生存时间更长。 铯137可以通过牛奶或蔬菜中的食物链传播，并可能增加罹患各种癌症的风险； 锶90被人体骨骼和牙齿吸收，会增加患白血病或骨癌的风险。 吸入的239239有毒
